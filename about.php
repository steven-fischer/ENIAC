The team is comprised of students with a range of skills from front-end work in Web Design to database support, and more.  This portfolio hosting site is the first major project of our bachelorâ€™s program spanning two quarters, from Fall of 2016 to Winter of 2017.  In the Fall of 2016, the group started with project planning, wireframes, and some initial coding.  The bulk of the project work was completed during the Winter quarter, which mostly comprised of the front-end and back-end coding.</p>
